# Automation_Excel_Query_Creation
Automate regression testing data preparation by populating data for different scenarios from excel spreadsheets to a database table.
Suppose you need to verify HRA calculation of an employee based on his basic salary with the conditions like
If employee lives in State1, HRA is 50% of basic.
If employee lives in State2, HRA is 40% of basic.
If employee lives in State3, HRA is 30% of basic.
Now we might to create this data time again to verify different scenarios. We will create an excel sheet, keep this data there, run the program to get insert queries. During automation, generating data in the way can save a lot of time.
